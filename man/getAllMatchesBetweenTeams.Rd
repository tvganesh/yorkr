\description{
This function gets all the data on matches between opposing teams for e.g India-Pakistan,
Englad-Australia, South Africa- Sri Lanka etc. It constructs a huge dataframe of all these
matches. This can be saved by the user which can be used in function in which analyses are
done for all matches between these teams. This is done by loading the saved .RData for
each match and performing an rbind of the data frames for each match
